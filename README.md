# Diabetes_LinReg
Exploration of Factors Affecting Diabetes
Key Objectives of This Project:
Exploration of Factors Affecting Diabetes: The project likely identifies and analyzes various factors (independent variables) contributing to diabetes-related outcomes (dependent variable).
Linear Regression Modeling: It builds linear regression models to quantify relationships between predictors (e.g., age, weight, blood glucose levels) and diabetes-related outcomes (e.g., risk score, disease progression).
Statistical Analysis: The project may include statistical evaluation of model performance metrics like R-squared, p-values, and residual analysis to validate results.
Data Insights: By interpreting regression coefficients, the project uncovers the significance and impact of specific factors in diabetes management or diagnosis.
